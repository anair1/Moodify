# Moodify ðŸŽµðŸŽ§

Moodify is a Flask web app that generates a personalized playlist for users based on their Spotify listening history and their current mood. Users can log into Spotify, describe the vibe they are feeling, and Moodify will use AI (GPT model) to interpret the mood and generate a playlist by leveraging Spotify's API.
